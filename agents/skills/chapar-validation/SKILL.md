# Chapar validation

Validation requires `selection.json`, its exact digest, and the matching target
contract. It derives one module tree, exact selected roots/checks, Slurm
placement, and a tuple/release/run result namespace. Do not restore environment
dispatch or architecture-directory scanning.

Integrity remains hardware-free. Preserve exit 77 as SKIP and stable
PASS/WARN/FAIL/SKIP JSON and Prometheus fields. Unknown/mixed selections,
missing roots, and contract/digest drift fail before module load/submission.

Run parser/dry-run fixtures only unless the user explicitly approves target
execution. Never claim a plan ran Slurm, loaded modules, or validated hardware.
`/resources/chapar/vlad` and `/resources/chapar/hpcsim` are immutable legacy
shadow/canary roots, not discovery inputs. Offline contract and selection
behavior is verified; target-platform behavior not validated.
