# Chapar container delivery

`containers/images/targets.json` is the target registry and
`containers/images/containers.json` is the container registry. Consumers must
load them; duplicated base/target dictionaries are not authority.

| Public container | Accepted set | Allowed targets |
|---|---|---|
| `nvidia-vlad` | `vlad` | `linux-x86_64-v4`, `linux-aarch64-gb300` |
| `ubuntu-hpcsim` | `hpcsim` | `linux-x86_64-generic` |

The selected release is produced from `envs/software/spack.yaml` plus a
reviewed `datacenters/<id>` target contract. Image planning verifies immutable
selection, contract, registry, effective-manifest, target-policy,
release-metadata, and release-local-lock digests. Injection preserves exact
build-time prefixes, includes link/run closure, and exposes one opt-in module
destination.

`containers/images/sources-lock.json` is globally `blocked`; no image import,
export, candidate write, or publication is currently permitted. Internal
`vlad-image` runtime paths/units/variables remain for compatibility and do not
define another public container.

Use `README.md` for the canonical disposable offline flow. Plan-only image
fixtures live under `containers/images/tests/`; they do not prove a production
image build. `/resources/chapar/vlad` and `/resources/chapar/hpcsim` remain
immutable legacy shadow/canary roots with no migration or retirement approval.
Offline contract and selection behavior is verified; target-platform behavior
not validated.
